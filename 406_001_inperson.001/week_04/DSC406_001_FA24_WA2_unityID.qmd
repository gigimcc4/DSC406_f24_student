# 0. Introduction

**Understanding Our Data:**

-   **Survey Data:** The data we are using comes from a Census survey specifically designed to gather information about food security and economic factors in American households.

## ü§ø **Let‚Äôs Dive in:**

### Overview of the Survey

The [Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Food Security Supplement (FSS)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-food-security.html) is an integral part of national efforts to monitor the nutritional status of the United States population. This survey is conducted by the United States Census Bureau in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The primary focus of the CPS FSS is to evaluate the extent and severity of food insecurity in households across the country, including access to food by all members and the ability to afford sufficient food for healthy living.

### Data Collection

The Food Security Supplement is appended annually to the Census Population Survey (CPS), which is best known for providing the primary source of labor force statistics in the U.S. Data for the supplement are collected in December each year. Households included in the CPS are asked a series of additional questions concerning behaviors and experiences associated with food insecurity, such as skipping meals, reducing food intake, and participating in federal food assistance programs.

### Purpose of the Survey

The data collected serve several key purposes:

-   **Assessing Food Security**: The FSS measures the prevalence of food insecurity and hunger in households, including the severity and frequency of food-insecure conditions over the previous 12 months.

-   **Evaluating Federal Programs**: Insights from the survey help evaluate the effectiveness of federal and state food assistance programs aimed at reducing food insecurity.

-   **Informing Public Policy**: Policymakers use the data to better understand the needs of the population and to allocate resources effectively to combat food scarcity and insecurity.

### Structure of the Data

The dataset includes a wide range of variables covering various aspects of food security and economic strain, including:

-   **Food Expenditure**: Detailed accounting of money spent on food at supermarkets, grocery stores, restaurants, and other food outlets.

-   **Economic Strain and Coping Strategies**: Measures of economic pressures such as spending more to meet food needs, the ability to spend less, and utilization of food programs.

-   **Children's Food Security**: Specific focus on the conditions affecting children within households, assessing if children were not eating enough due to financial constraints.

-   **Assistance Programs**: Information on participation in programs like SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), school lunch programs, and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children).

### Significance for Learning

Understanding the variables and the overall structure of the CPS Food Security Supplement is essential for students and researchers focusing on public health, economics, social sciences, and policy studies. The dataset not only offers a detailed view of the food security landscape in the U.S. but also serves as a critical tool for gauging the effectiveness of programs aimed at mitigating food-related hardships.

In this lesson, we will explore how to manipulate and analyze this dataset to draw meaningful insights about food security trends and impacts of public assistance programs.

# 3. Wrangle

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
Say we hypothesize that **"Economic status influences the frequency and location of food purchases, reflecting varying levels of food security."**

And we have a guiding question: **"How do household economic status and shopping behaviors relate to food security levels?"**

We would need to do the first step in the EDA process, **Data Wrangling**.

## **dplyr package**

    **Instructions:**

    1.  Use the `select()` function to pick the relevant variables from `fss_survey` (see above).

    2.  Save the output to `prepared_data`.

```{r}
# ADD YOUR CODE BELOW with comments
prepared_data <- fss_survey %>%
  select(HRHHID,HRPOOR,HES1C,HES1D,HETS2O,HETS6O,HESS1,HESS4,HRNUMHOU)

#### Creating and Using Mutated Variables

**Objective:** Calculate total food spending by adding supermarket and restaurant expenditures.

**Task:** Use the `mutate()` function to add a new column `total_food_spending` to `new_name_fss`. Then, summarize this new column to see spending distribution.

**Instructions:**

1.  Add a new column that sums up supermarket and restaurant spending.

2.  Use `count()` to aggregate and count entries by `total_food_spending`.

```{r}
# ADD YOUR CODE BELOW with comments


```

Now count up the new total_food_spending

```{r}
# ADD YOUR CODE BELOW with comments

```

Reflect on what they notice about the distribution of total food spending across different economic statuses.

**Instructions:**

1.  Apply the `group_by()` function to `mutated_data` focusing on the `income_poverty_ratio`.

2.  Save the result in `grouped_data`.

**Instructions:**

1.  Using `grouped_data`, apply the `summarize()` function to calculate the `mean` and `sum` of `supermarket_food_spending` and `restaurant_food_spending`.

2.  Use `n()` to count the number of households in each income group.
